#creating package.json for my project

#fist created an empty directory create_Package.Json
then created package.json using npm init

after creating package.json if we install any packages their dependency details will get updated on the already created package.json 

Eg. here we have added the package give-me-a-joke 
hence nodue_modules and package-lock.json is created
